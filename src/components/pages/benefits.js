                    Doing research is quite essential before buying a new device. But how much research should you actually do?

                    <li className="benefits_point">&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider this. Let’s say you are buying a new laptop. These are some of the questions you should be able to answer…<br /><br />
Your total budget?
How important is weight or thinness to you?
Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List some programs/games you desire to run.
How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance and battery life?
Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?
If you’re gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?
<br /><br />
If you didn’t think of these many questions then you are probably missing out from choosing a device that will be ideal for you. And if you have your answers then doing a research like this would take time.
